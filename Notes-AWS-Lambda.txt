AWS Lambda notes

1. AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually 
any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. 
You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, 
and only pay for what you use.

2. All you need is to choose Runtime Environment 

3. A runtime is a version of a programming language or framework that you can use to write Lambda
 functions. Lambda supports runtime versions for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, C# (.NET Core), 
 and PowerShell (.NET Core)


Task / TO DO:
Build Cost Optimized Infrastructure.
Current Infrastructure there are 2 Environments: 1) Dev and 2) Prod 
Prod Environment is a critical Environment. Target is to have Zero Downtime in Prod Environment
But Unlike to Prod Environment Dev Environment is non critical. It means you can start and stop instances.
In Dev Environment you do development everyday from 9 am to 6 pm. 

In order to achieve this solution good option is to use Lambda Function. 

4. How will we trigger (run) Lambda Function? Answer: CloudWatch

5. Reason we are mostly using Python with Lambda because AWS has awesome SDK which is BOTO3.
